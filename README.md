# Rice-university-mini-projects
This repository is dedicated to the mini projects I finished for the Fundamentals of Computing Specialization by Rice University

## Acknowledgement
SimpleGUI is a Python package for creating graphical user interfaces, developed by a team of developers including Professor Scott Rixner of Rice University https://www.cs.rice.edu/~rixner/. It is the key requirement for the projects functionality.

## CodeSkuptor
You can run the codes in CodeSkulptor; an interactive, web-based Python programming environment that allows Python code to be run in a web browser. This application is also developed by professor Scott Rixner.
Simply just copy the codes, then paste and run them in CodeSkulptor.
